          Discover a fun-filled world of wonder at the
          <span>Community Science Museum!</span> Explore glowing planets,
          buzzing robots, and hands-on experiments that make science come alive.
          With over 1,000 exciting exhibits to uncover, there’s something for
          every curious mind—whether you're fascinated by space, nature,
          technology, or even ancient dinosaurs (just don’t ask what they do
          after dark). Bring your questions, your curiosity, and maybe even your
          lab goggles—there’s always something new to learn and love. Who knew
          science could be this fun?

          <h2>Visiting Professor of Aeronautics</h2>
          <p>
            It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
            on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
            exciting ‘space’.

          <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.

          <p>
            Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
            sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
            sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the
