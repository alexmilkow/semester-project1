          Discover a fun-filled world of wonder at the
          <span class="bold">Community Science Museum!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Explore glowing planets, chatty robots, and awesome hands-on
          experiments that make science feel like magic you can actually touch.
          With over 1,000 exciting, colorful, and interactive exhibits to
          discover, there’s something amazing for every curious kid - whether
          you're into outer space, wild animals, cool inventions, or even giant
          dinosaurs (just don’t ask what they’re up to after dark… it’s top
          secret).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bring your big questions, your wild ideas, and maybe even your
          super-cool lab goggles - because there’s always something new to try,
          build, and laugh about. Who knew science could be this exciting, this
          weird, and this much fun for kids (and grown-ups) who love to explore?

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
              powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
              able to use and control wind to create power.

              Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as

              own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the
              wonders of science.
